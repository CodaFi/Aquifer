//: Introduction

//: The `Aquifer` library decouples stream processing stages from each other so
//: that you can mix and match diverse stages to produce useful streaming
//: programs.  If you are a library writer, `Aquifer` lets you package up
//: streaming components into a reusable interface.  If you are an application
//: writer, `Aquifer` lets you connect pre-made streaming components with minimal
//: effort to produce a highly-efficient program that streams data in constant
//: memory.
//:
//: To enforce loose coupling, components can only communicate using two
//: commands:
//:
//: * `yield`: Send output data
//:
//: * `await`: Receive input data
//:
//: `Aquifer` has four types of components built around these two commands:
//:
//: * `Producer`s can only `yield` values and they model streaming sources
//:
//: * `Consumer`s can only `await` values and they model streaming sinks
//:
//: * `Pipe`s can both `yield` and `await` values and they model stream
//: transformations
//:
//: * `Effect`s can neither `yield` nor `await` and they model non-streaming
//: components
//:
//: You can connect these components together in four separate ways which
//: parallel the four above types:
//:
//: * `for_` handles `yield`s
//:
//: * `>~` handles `await`s
//:
//: * `>->` handles both `yield`s and `await`s
//:
//: * `>>-` handles return values
//:
//: As you connect components their types will change to reflect inputs and
//: outputs that you`ve fused away.  You know that you`re done connecting things
//: when you get an `Effect`, meaning that you have handled all inputs and
//: outputs.  You run this final `Effect` to begin streaming.

import Swiftz
import Aquifer

//: Producers

//: `Producer`s are effectful streams of input.  Specifically, a `Producer` is a
//: Type that extends any other type with a new `yield` command. This `yield` 
//: command lets you send output downstream to an anonymous handler, decoupling
//: how you generate values from how you consume them.

//: The following `stdinByLine` `Producer` shows how to incrementally read in
//: `String`s from standard input and `yield` them downstream, terminating
//: gracefully when reaching the end of the input:

import class Foundation.NSFileHandle

//:                                  +----------  A `Producer` that yields `String`s
//:                                  |
//:                                  |        +-- Every action has a return value.
//:                                  |        |   This action returns `()` when finished
//:                                  v        v
public func stdinByLine() -> Producer<String, ()>.T {
	let handle = NSFileHandle.fileHandleWithStandardInput() // Grab the handle
	if handle.isAtEndOfFile { // If we`re at the end of the line, stop.
		return pure(())
	} else {
		return yield(handle.readLine) >>- { _ in fromHandle(handle) } // Otherwise `yield` the line and loop.
	}
}

//: `yield` emits a value, suspending the current `Producer` until the value is
//: consumed.  If nobody consumes the value (which is possible) then `yield`
//: never returns.  You can think of `yield` as having the following type:
//:
//:     func yield<A>(value : A) -> Producer<A, ()>.T
//:
//: The true type of `yield` is actually more general and powerful.  Throughout
//: the tutorial I will present type signatures like this that are simplified at
//: first and then later reveal more general versions.  So read the above type
//: signature as simply saying: "You can use `yield` within a `Producer`, but
//: you may be able to use `yield` in other contexts, too."
//:
//: Click the link to `yield` to navigate to its documentation.  There you will
//: see that `yield` actually uses the `Producer` (with an apostrophe) type
//: synonym which hides a lot of polymorphism behind a simple veneer.  The
//: documentation for `yield` says that you can also use `yield` within a
//: `Pipe`, too, because of this polymorphism:
//:
//     func yield<UO, UI, DO>(@autoclosure(escaping) value: () -> DO) -> Proxy<UO, UI, (), DO, ()>
//:
//: Use simpler types like these to guide you until you understand the fully
//: general type.

//: `for_` loops are the simplest way to consume a `Producer` like `stdinByLine`.
//: `for_` has the following type:
//:
//                        +-- Producer      +-- The body of the   +-- Result
//                        |   to loop       |   loop              |
//                        v   over          v                     v
//                        --------------       ---------------     ---------
//     func for_<A, R>(p: Producer<A, R>.T, _ f: A -> Effect<()>.T) -> Effect<R>.T
//
//: `for_(producer, body)` loops over `producer`, substituting each `yield` in
//: `producer` with `body`.
//:
//: You can also deduce that behavior purely from the type signature:
//:
//: * The body of the loop takes exactly one argument of type @(a)@, which is
//: the same as the output type of the `Producer`.  Therefore, the body of the
//: loop must get its input from that `Producer` and nowhere else.
//:
//: * The return value of the input `Producer` matches the return value of the
//: result, therefore `for_` must loop over the entire `Producer` and not skip
//: anything.
//:
//: The above type signature is not the true type of `for_`, which is actually
//: more general.  Think of the above type signature as saying: "If the first
//: argument of `for_` is a `Producer` and the second argument returns an
//: `Effect`, then the final result must be an `Effect`."
//:
//: Click the link to `for_` to navigate to its documentation.  There you will
//: see the fully general type and underneath you will see equivalent simpler
//: types.  One of these says that if the body of the loop is a `Producer`, then
//: the result is a `Producer`, too:
//:
//     func for_<UO, UI, DI, DO, NI, NO, FR>(p: Proxy<UO, UI, DI, DO, FR>, _ f: DO -> Proxy<UO, UI, NI, NO, DI>) -> Proxy<UO, UI, NI, NO, FR>
//:
//: The first type signature I showed for `for_` was a special case of this
//: slightly more general signature because a `Producer` that never `yield`s is
//: also an `Effect`:
//:
//     `X` is an "uninhabited" type.  Practically, this means all attempts to
//     construct an `X` will fail catastrophically.
//     struct X { //... }
//
//: This is why `for` permits two different type signatures.  The first type
//: signature is just a special case of the second one:
//
//     func for_<A, B, R>(p : Producer<A, R>, f : (A -> Producer<B, ()>) -> Producer<B, R> 
//
//     Specialize `B` to `X`
//     func for_<A, R>(p : Producer<A, R>, f : (A -> Producer<X, ()>) -> Producer<X, R>
//
//     Producer<X, ?> == Effect
//     func for_<A, R>(p : Producer<A, R>, f : (A -> Effect<()>) -> Effect<R>
//
//: This is the same trick that all `Aquifer` functions use to work with various
//: combinations of `Producer`s, `Consumer`s, `Pipe`s, and `Effect`s.  Each
//: function really has just one general type, which you can then simplify
//: down to multiple useful alternative types.
//:
//: Here`s an example use of a `for` `loop`, where the second
//: argument (the loop body) is an `Effect`:
//:

// more concise: `return for_(stdinByLine, Effect.T.pure â€¢ print)`
func loop() -> Effect<()> {
    return for_(stdinByLine()) { str in
        return Effect.T.pure(print(str))    
    }
}
//: In this example, 'for' loops over @stdinLn@ and replaces every 'yield' in
//: `stdinByLine` with the body of the loop, printing each line.  This is exactly
//: equivalent to the following code, which I've placed side-by-side with the
//: original definition of @stdinLn@ for comparison:
//:
//: 
//
